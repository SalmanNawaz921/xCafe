# xCafe
During my internship, I created a simple landing page for "xCafe" to facilitate table reservations and showcase the menu. The page includes a welcoming introduction, a section highlighting popular menu items, and a form for customers to reserve tables.

## Features
- **Header**: Contains the cafe's name and a navigation menu.
- **Introduction Section**: A brief description of xCafe.
- **Menu Section**: Highlights popular items served at xCafe.
- **Reservation Form**: Allows visitors to reserve tables.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For form validation and interactivity.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salmannawaz921/xcafe.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd xcafe
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the landing page.
